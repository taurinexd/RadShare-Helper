**RadShare Helper** is a lightweight desktop application designed to streamline recruiting for Void Relic runs in Warframe. It simplifies writing and sharing specific recruiting messages in the **Recruiting channel**, ensuring accuracy and speed.

## ✨ Features

- **Relic Database**: Instantly find any relic (Lith, Meso, Neo, Axi, Requiem, Vanguard).
- **One-Click Format & Copy**: Automatically prepares and copies recruiting messages for your selected relic and state.
- **State Toggles**: Quickly switch between **Intact (I)**, **Exceptional (E)**, **Flawless (F)**, and **Radiant (R)**.
- **Host & Cycle Management**:
